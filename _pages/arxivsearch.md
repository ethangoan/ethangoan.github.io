    title: "MCMC"
    excerpt: "MCMC has remained the gold standard for Bayesian inference, though is often overlooked within the ML community due to it's (perceived) computational complexity. Follow along here to keep up to date with the most recent research for MCMC methods applied to ML problems."

    excerpt: "If there is one thing the machine learning does well, it is non-convex optimisation. This page lists modern papers submitted which aim to convert probabilistic inference into an optimisation problem. (Some Monte Carlo methods are also listed here as well)"

Research never stands still, and this is especially true for machine learning. Stay up to date with recent pre-prints submitted to arXiv relating to probabilistic methods and fairness in ML. List is updated each Friday at approx 12:30pm AEST (+10 GMT). This project was inspired by the [arXausality](https://github.com/logangraham/arxausality) package created by [Logan Graham](http://logangraham.xyz/). Code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/ethangoan/arxivsearch). If you want me to add a category, just send me an email and will be happy to add to the list.
