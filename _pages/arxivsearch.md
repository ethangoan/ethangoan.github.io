Research never stands still, and this is especially true for machine learning. Stay up to date with recent pre-prints submitted to arXiv relating to probabilistic methods and fairness in ML. List is updated each Friday at approx 12:30pm AEST (+10 GMT). This project was inspired by the [arXausality](https://github.com/logangraham/arxausality) package created by [Logan Graham](http://logangraham.xyz/). Code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/ethangoan/arxivsearch). If you want me to add a category, just send me an email and will be happy to add to the list.
