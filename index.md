## Brief Bio
I am a first year PhD. student at QUT as a member of the [SAIVT](https://research.qut.edu.au/saivt/),  [BRAG](https://bragqut.wordpress.com/) and [BMDS](http://www.biomedicaldatascience.com/) labs. I am interested in using using probabilistic methods to better understand deep learning, and how we can use these methods to visualise uncertainty in computer vision tasks.

More to come, site is a work in progress. The [arXivSearch](_pages/arxivsearch) is relatively complete, so if you are interested in the most recent preprints relating to Bayesian NNs, fairness in ML and more, please go check it out!
